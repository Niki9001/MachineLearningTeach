1. What's the difference between regression and classification?
Generally speaking, classification is predict a small amount of number of possible outputs
Regression is predict infinitely possible outputs.
2. What is the training set?
Training set is dataset used to train model.
3. How to notation?
We assume that x is an input variable, it is a feature to find the right formula.
Then y is an output variable, it is a target variable, which is the model learning from
(x,y) = single training example
x(i),y(i) = ith training example
4. How does a simple machine learning model work?
training set -------> leanring algorithm ---------> f (a model)
x (feature) ---------------> f (model) ---------------> y^
size ----------> model -----------> price estimated
5. How to represent f
f(x) = wx + b
6. How to describe the f(x) = wx + b model?
Linear regression with one variable.
Univariate linear regression
7. What is the w and b?
We call them parameters, coefficients or weights.
