1. What is the typical linar regression expression?
f(x) = wx + b
This is a standard quadratic equation of one variable. It also a linar regression, if we plot it on a Cartesian coordinate system.
After we plot, we will find it shows that the result is a straight line.

2. How linar regression works on Machine Learning?
In f(x) = wx + b, we know that x is one parameter we input, we are looking for the most properly w and b to create a model to make our input fit our expectation.

3. How to write this expression in python
def test(x,w,b):
    m = x.shape[0]
    fwb = np.zeros(m)
    for i in range(m):
        fwb[i] = w * x[i] + b
    return fwb

In this function, x should be a numpy array.
