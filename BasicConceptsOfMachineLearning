1. What is machine learning
Machine Learning is the study of how computers can simulate or implement human learning behavior to acquire new knowledge or skills, and reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve their own performance. It is the core of artificial intelligence and the fundamental way to make computers intelligent.
2. How does machine learning work
Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence that analyzes, processes, and understands data generated by human behavioral activities to achieve automated learning, reasoning, and decision-making without human interaction.
The essence of machine learning is to simulate as much as possible the way humans think when making a certain decision by analyzing the data structure and the relationship between data.
