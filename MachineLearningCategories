  Supervised learning
  Unsupervised learning

2. How to understand supervised learning.
  Functions in mathematics: In mathematics, if we know x and y, and know the exact relationship between them, we can define a function f(x), which can accurately describe the relationship between x and y . Likewise, if we know x and the function f(x), we can calculate the corresponding y.
  Functions in Machine Learning: In supervised learning, we typically have a set of data points for x and corresponding y, but we don’t know the exact mathematical relationship between them. Our goal is to find a function f(x) that tries to describe the relationship between x and y as closely as possible. This function f(x) may not be perfect, but we want it to be close enough to make accurate y predictions for new x values.
  Model training and prediction: In machine learning, we “learn” the function f(x) by training a model. This process involves using large amounts of data with known x and y pairs to continuously adjust the parameters of our model so that its predictions are as close as possible to the true y values. Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict the output y for a new input x.
  Therefore, supervised learning can be broadly understood as: we have some input data x, and our goal is to find a suitable function f(x) so that the output generated by this function based on the input x is as close as possible to the known target output y.

3. Understand unsupervised learning with an example.
  Imagine you are a biologist with a collection of plant samples from different regions. These samples contain various characteristic information about the plants, such as leaf shape, color, size, etc., but you do not know which species these plants belong to.
  In the supervised learning scenario, you already know which species each sample belongs to, and your task is to build a model based on the characteristics that can classify new plant samples into species. But in this unsupervised learning example, you don't have this label information.
  Clustering: Your goal might be to group these plants by their characteristics, i.e. try to find which plants are similar to each other in characteristics. This is clustering. With clustering, you might find that certain plants that are similar in leaf size and shape are grouped into one group, while others that are similar in color or other characteristics are grouped into another group.
  Dimensionality reduction: Another possible task is dimensionality reduction. This can complicate analysis if each plant sample has dozens or hundreds of different characteristics. Dimensionality reduction techniques can help you reduce the number of features while trying to retain the most important information. This way, you might focus on only a few of the most critical features, such as leaf size and shape, and ignore other, less important features.
  Association rule learning: Another possibility is association rule learning. For example, you might find that certain traits often appear together under certain environmental conditions, such as leaves of a certain shape and size being more common in arid areas.
  In this example of unsupervised learning, you are exploring the data without any predefined categories or labels, trying to discover patterns or structures within it. Your goal is not to predict or classify (like supervised learning), but to understand the inherent relationships and structure in the data.

4. Examples of supervised learning
  Classification
    Email Spam Detection: In this problem, our goal is to build a model to predict whether an email is spam or not. Here, the input is various features of the email (such as text content, sender, etc.) and the output is one of two categories: spam or not spam.
  Regression
    Predict stock price movements. Models may consider multiple economic indicators and past stock price information to predict future stock prices.
